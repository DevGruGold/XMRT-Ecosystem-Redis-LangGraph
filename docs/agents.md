# Agent Integration Status

This document outlines the current status of agent integration within the XMRT-Ecosystem, specifically focusing on the Redis and LangGraph integration.

## Current Status

As of July 30, 2025, the foundational repository for Redis and LangGraph integration has been successfully prepared and pushed to GitHub. This includes:

- **Repository Setup**: A new GitHub repository (`XMRT-Ecosystem-Redis-LangGraph`) has been created and initialized.
- **Core Components**: Initial Python modules for Redis cache management, LangGraph workflow orchestration, and an autonomous improvement workflow have been added.
- **Shared Utilities**: Common utilities and exception handling modules are in place.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker configurations (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml) for setting up Redis, the integration service, Prometheus, and Grafana have been provided.
- **Documentation**: A comprehensive `README.md` detailing the project's overview, architecture, features, and getting started guide has been created.
- **Environment Configuration**: An `.env.example` file has been added to guide environment variable setup.

## Next Steps

- Implement specific agent functionalities leveraging Redis for state management and LangGraph for complex decision flows.
- Develop and integrate additional workflows as identified in the XMRT-Ecosystem structure evaluation.
- Conduct thorough testing of all integrated components.
- Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
- Monitor performance and optimize resource utilization.
